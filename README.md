## Objectives:
- Analyze how customer demographics affect bike purchasing decisions.
- Investigate key factors like homeownership, number of children, and commute distance.
- Segment customers to identify which groups are more likely to buy a bike.
- Create an interactive Excel dashboard with pivot tables and charts.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for targeted marketing and sales strategies.

  # Process
- I examined the dataset for missing values using Excel's "Go To Special" function to identify blank cells.   
- Duplicates were identified and removed using Excelâ€™s "Remove Duplicates" feature to prevent redundant entries from skewing the analysis.  
- Date columns were standardized to the MM/DD/YYYY format, and any dates listed as text were converted into proper date format using the `DATEVALUE` function.  
- Column headings were reviewed and standardized for consistency, ensuring clarity with names.  
- I filtered the dataset to include only relevant columns for analysis, such as sales date, region, sales figures, unit price, and customer demographics, ensuring the data was focused.  
- Additionally, I ensured that numeric columns, such as sales figures and prices, were set to the correct data type (number or currency) for proper analysis.

  # Project Insights
- Short-distance commuters bought more bikes, likely due to the convenience and cost-effectiveness of cycling for daily travel.
- Singles with no children were the most frequent buyers, suggesting that individuals with fewer responsibilities may have more disposable income and a greater interest in personal transportation.
- Homeowners purchased more bikes, potentially due to having more space for storage and a greater sense of stability to invest in a bike.
- Males with higher incomes were more likely to buy bikes, indicating that this demographic has more purchasing power for premium or specialized models.
- Middle-aged customers (around 31-54 years old) bought more bikes, suggesting that this age group values biking for health, leisure, or commuting purposes.

  # Final Conclusion
This analysis of bike sales data provided valuable insights into customer behavior and sales trends.These groups tend to purchase more bikes, with preferences leaning toward convenience, quality, suggesting a need for adjusted marketing strategies and inventory planning.
These insights can help businesses refine their target audience, optimize product offerings, and tailor marketing campaigns to meet the needs of high-potential customer segments. Additionally, the analysis provides a solid foundation for improving sales forecasting and making informed decisions around pricing, inventory, and promotions.
